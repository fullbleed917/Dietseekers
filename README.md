# Dietseekers
This is a Code Test I recently did of DietSeekers site redesign using Bootstrap 4 & JQuery.
The Coding challenge was to redesign the site at https://dietseekers.com/1/ and focus on the functionality. The site is buit with Bulma but you can rebuild it with any framework you wish. The challenge is to redesign the site and have the questions answered on the page print out the answers at the bottom of the page for the user to see.
